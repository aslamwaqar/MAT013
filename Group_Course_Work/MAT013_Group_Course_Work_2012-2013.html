<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>The outputs of this coursework will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 20 minute group presentation/demonstration to be given on the 17/5/2013 followed by 10 minutes for question.</li>
<li>All relevant files (code, presentation, notes etc...), websites, demo materials etc should be passed to Joanna Emery or Vincent Knight on the 17/5/2013.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coursework">Coursework</h2>
<p>As a group you are required to present an aspect of R and/or SAS that is not present in the notes. The presentation should be viewed as a teaching presentation and here are some potential examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrating how to use a particular aspect of R and/or SAS (an R package for example);</li>
<li>Explaining certain technical aspects of R and/or SAS (for example if the Program Data Vector had not been explained in class this would have been a potential subject);</li>
<li>Solving a particular problem using R and/or SAS using techniques not specifically looked at.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are not constrained by the use of slides (although you are welcome to). Feel free to be imaginative.</p>
<p><strong>On selection of a topic, it is advisable to ask Vincent Knight whether or not it is suitable.</strong></p>
