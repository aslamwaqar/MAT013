1.  Create the data set "first_data_set" from the notes and export to csv.

2.  Download the files [JJJ.csv](../Data/C1+C2/JJJ.csv) and [MMM.csv](../Data/C1+C2/MMM.csv) import them in to R.

3.  View both the MMM and JJJ data sets.

4.  View the structure of the MMM and JJJ data sets using the str command.

5.  Obtain the mean age, height in metres and weight in kg for the observations of the MMM and JJJ datasets.

6.  Obtain the mean age, height in metres and weight in kg for the observations of the MMM and JJJ datasets compartmentalising your output by sex (you'll need to use the by function).

7.  Download the file [math_tests.csv](../Data/C1+C2/math_tests.csv), import it in to R and output a frequency table of teachers against pass\_fail.

8.  Obtain correlation tables for all the numerical values in JJJ and MMM (using 2 separate approaches (one of which will require you to download a package).

9.  Do a regression analysis of the variable height\_in\_metres against weight\_in\_kg and savings\_in\_poundsfor the data sets JJJ and MMM.

10. Download the data set [math.csv](../Data/C1+C2/math.csv) and run an ANOVA test to see if the grades depends on the professor.

11. Obtain a histogram for the variables weight\_in\_kg for the data sets JJJ and MMM.

12. Obtain a scatter plot of weight\_in\_kg against height\_in\_metres for the data sets JJJ and MMM

13. Output all of the above graphs to a pdf file.
