#MAT013 - R: C4 - Challenge Sheet
##Programming

Create a function in R that outputs the first $k$ prime number to a csv file (do so without using any built in test for primality). Build the function so that it takes two input arguments:

- $k$
- a string: the name of the output file.

Prepare a presentation on the above, making full use of the features discussed in chapter 4 of the course notes. Include the code used in your presentation.
